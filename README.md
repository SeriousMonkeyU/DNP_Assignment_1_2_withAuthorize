# DNP_Assignment_1_2_withAuthorize


First of All. We have another repository with Working Users and Posts (1 Assignment).
We tried to do Authorize part, sadly, not very successful. This is the part. It is also updated with some extra variables and information
for every user. Some minor differences maybe present between this version and the version without Authorization part (not counting the Authorization Impl.).
As our group experienced continuous problems with correctly updating different branches on github and updating other branches, we decided to work
on split parts either alone, or using our own repositories. After merging these repositories, we end up with 2. One with the working features of asssignment
1 and one with not working ones of assignment 2. That is the reason, you cannot really see which changes were made and by whom alongside assignments implementation.
We are sorry about that.
